# 1. Matching with *

### using glob command *

**Flag:** `pwn.college{EXbEAXo_tTD8mzTWAsj8T1WG3lV.QXxIDO0wyM3gjNzEzW}`

as per the challenge, we are suppose to cd to the challenge directory with only four characters, so we use `cd /ch*` to cd into /challenge directory since /ch consist of it. after reaching the directory, we did `/challenge/run` and those got the flag

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EXbEAXo_tTD8mzTWAsj8T1WG3lV.QXxIDO0wyM3gjNzEzW}
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$

```
